## Description

This was a solo project, based on a template provided, which contained the structure of the app without any actionability or content such as: imagery, specific fonts or images.
<br>The purpose of this project was to decide on implementing a style guide and its associated components, as well as creating a prototype in actionability.
Each movie is prevented with an overlay / modal, where pressing outside the overlay will close it 

As accessibility is important to me, I accounted for aspects of this in my design.

These are the components of this project:
* Style guide
* Colour contrast accessibility
* Designed screens
* Colour blindness accessibility
* Attributions

## Style Guide

### Mood Board

### Fonts

I decided that I wanted to have 3 different typefaces, each serving a different purpose in my prototype. 

I chose a decorative typeface, Krungthep, which I use for the login button and heading text to catch the readers attention, as the login button serves as a call to action and it draws my user towards the ‚Äònow playing‚Äô heading, making them more likely to view this message. This means that users are more likely to know that the movies are now playing, as opposed to seeing an arbitrary list of films where the context is not clear.

I then chose to have a serif font, Kelly Slab, for readability due to the serifs. I use this font for my main headings, as well as the film titles and descriptions. Additionally, the film titles themselves, as well as the description serve as the main basis for the prototype, thus readability is of paramount importance.

I finally chose a sans-serif font, Poppins, to pair with my serif font to act as the subtext for the film genre, providing contrast between the main text. Additionally, I used this font in the username input box, as many username and password input elements typically use a sans-serif font. E.g Roboto for signing into Google owned services.

### Colours
![cin-colours](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2de7f4f9-055f-4bef-992f-d3bb9fdc8ac1)

My colours selection was initially inspired by my mood board, especially the dark red and black synonymous with traditional theatres combined with a buttery off white colour akin to that of popcorn. This also explains my logo choice. I also used black and the off white shade to refer to a clapperboard. Furthermore, the translucent smoky coloured name banner for each image represents a roll of film, which is also a translucent strip.

Initially, I did have a much darker shade of red, however, even when changing the accent colour to one that is much lighter, I had many contrast accessibility issues. Therefore I adjusted each colour accordingly in order to comply with WCAG AA standards whilst still maintaining semblance to my intended theme.

I did also generate some colour blindness representative screens with the aid of the Color Blind plugin. Whilst I didn‚Äôt necessarily adjust my theme solely for this, I wanted to show the difference in how my design appears to other people, and if this prototype was iterated upon, I would certainly make changes to accommodate individuals who do not have trichromatism (‚ÄòTypical‚Äô colour vision).

I do feel that by keeping a strong theme that this still helps regardless. For instance, many people with colour blindness would still associate the theatre with their perception of this colour. However, I would conduct further research to see see how the UX varies for non-trichromatic individuals, to find some semblance of a middle ground where the UI and UX is strong for all individuals on the visual spectrum.
