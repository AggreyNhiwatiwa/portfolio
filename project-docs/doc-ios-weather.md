# Weather app (iOS)

A simple iOS weather app made in collaboration with https://www.github.com/liviodr , made using Swift, using the Weather API (https://www.weatherapi.com/)
The app allows a user to search for a location or use their own location to receive the matching data from the API

The app allows a user to switch between using Celsius and Fahrenheit for both the home screen and their listed locations
