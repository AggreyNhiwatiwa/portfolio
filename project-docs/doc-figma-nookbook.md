This app concept is a fictional companion app based on the game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. In this project, the UX design process was followed, which included research, analysis, design, prototyping, and user testing.

The work in Figma consisted of the following:

* User personas
* User scenario map
* User storyboard
* User flows
* Mood board and style guide
* Medium fidelity wireframes
* High fidelity functional prototype
