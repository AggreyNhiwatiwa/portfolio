# Electric Vehicle Charger Admin Centre ðŸ”‹

This is a project that I am actively developing as a minimum viable product for a Fortune 500 company (internal tool). The purpose of this is to manage customers and employees who own electric vehicles and would like to use the on premises electric vehicle chargers. Users, vehicles and chargers can all be registered and bookings can be made using these entities. 

Two versions are being devloped, a cross platform version built with React Native, and a Progressive Web Application (PWA) version.

## React Native Version âš›


Here are a few screenshots of my app!

### Details
* Languages: Vanilla JS, JSX
* Frameworks: React Native Expo
* Data Storage: Firebase Firestore
* Other: The React Context API was used to avoid excessive prop drilling in my deep nested component hierarchy





## PWA Version










Proposed upcoming changes for both versions:
Firebase authentication.
Depending on the proposed features I could migrate from using the Context API to Redux.
