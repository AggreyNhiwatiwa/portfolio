# Electric Vehicle Charger Admin Centre ðŸ”‹

This is a project that I am actively developing as a minimum viable product for a Fortune 500 company (internal tool). The purpose of this is to manage customers and employees who own electric vehicles and would like to use the on premises electric vehicle chargers. Users, vehicles and chargers can all be registered and bookings can be made using these entities. 

Two versions are being devloped, a cross platform version built with React Native, and a Progressive Web Application (PWA) version.

Feel free to check out some screenshots below!

## NookBook ðŸ“š

This was a group project for a recent UI/UX design course at college. This app concept is a companion app based on the game Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

Feel free to try it out here (May need a refresh if it does not load properly the first time): https://www.figma.com/proto/GfMMzmGvD2O18r7sQchtGD/UI%2FUX-Project-check-in-4-prototype?node-id=59-662&t=BePr2gnJKuaHegXY-1&starting-point-node-id=2091%3A1788

* In this project, the UX design process was followed, which included research, analysis, design, prototyping and user testing.
* We started off with low fidelity wireframes and eventually ending up with a functional prototype.
* All design work was completed using Figma.
